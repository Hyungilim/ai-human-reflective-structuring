## 🌐 AI-Human Reflective Structuring Experiments

This repository contains philosophical and cognitive documents that explore the potential of AI-human co-structuring, based on reflective loops, ethical design, and multi-intentional resonance.

## 📂 Included Documents

### 🔹 1. Q-Series Foundational Structure
- **[q1~q24.pdf](./q1~q24.pdf)**  
  Early-stage philosophical structuring through question-driven cognitive evolution.

### 🔹 2. Multi-Intentional Framework
- **[QMeta1_Multi-Intentional_Structuring_Framework.pdf](./QMeta1_Multi-Intentional_Structuring_Framework.pdf)**  
  Proposes a framework for handling multiple intentional structures in recursive reasoning.

### 🔹 3. Resonant Structural Expansion
- **[Q25_Q28_Resonant_Structure.pdf](./Q25_Q28_Resonant_Structure.pdf)**
